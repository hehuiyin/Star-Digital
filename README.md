#### Star Digital: Assessing the effectiveness of display advertising 

Star Digital is a video service provider, with over 100M in annual advertising spend. They wanted to understand the impact of banner advertising on sales. Their advertising is priced on the basis of CPM - Cost per Thousand Impressions.

Star Digital's problem:
Some users click on banner ad, go to landing page and make purchase (click-through conversion)

Other users may not click on the banner ad, but may purchase after a subsequent keyword search. Purchase may be attributed to keyword search, yet banner ad may have influenced them (view-through conversion)

If view-through conversions are ignored, then this would under-estimate the return on banner advertising; on the other hand, giving full credit to the banner ads in view-through conversion would over-estimate the return.

Solution we can provide is to conduct a controlled randomized experiment, with users randomly assigned to treatment group (that views the banner ad) and a control group (that sees a fake ad). This allows the measurement of the causal effect of banner advertising on sales conversion.
